sector.marsh.description = This is the real Greenland, unlike it's IRL counterpart. There's too few ground holes here so you would need the [accent]Chemical Cooking Chamber[] to generate more electricity. Also you need to nuke a smol Malisahh beis here.
sector.peaks.description = The sekhtor generator is broken so it generates this shit map. \nThere are too few usable lands available here and also most people here are useless so you would need to create an aircraft to nuke the Malisahh beis detected here.

sector.crossroads.description = There are alot of Malisahh beis here that requires different type of people. Nuke it using T4 of your choice. This map grants you access to [accent]Beam Link[] that has an insanely long range and can connect diagonally.
sector.crossroads.details = Beam Link is exclusive to V8 tho.
sector.karst.description = There's no Malisahh base here and also there's less swarms count detected here. The Malisahh attak should be very weak, right? Well, I don't think so. Also you can unlock [accent]Sand Eater[] here.
sector.origin.description = The last Malisahh beis. Malisahh won't give a fuck and will send their best army to nuke your beis. There's nothing you can unlok after landing here so focus solely on nuking the massive Malisahh beis here.
